# Mimi - A Multi-functional Discord Bot

Mimi is a powerful and versatile Discord bot built with TypeScript, discord.js v14, and PostgreSQL. Originally a JavaScript project, it has been completely refactored to enhance performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## üåü Features

*   **üìà Asset Reporting**: Fetches and displays historical price data for various assets, complete with detailed charts showing price and volume.
*   **üèÜ Gacha Luck Ranking**: Tracks and ranks users' luck in gacha-style games with the `/odog` command, providing detailed statistics.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è Keyword Auto-Reply**: Automatically replies to pre-configured keywords with either exact or partial matching.
*   **üëç Channel Auto-Reaction**: Automatically adds a specific emoji reaction to every new message in designated channels.
*   **‚úÖ Personal Todo List**: A simple yet effective to-do list management system for every user.
*   **üìä User-Specific Reports**: Generates detailed reports on user activity, including command usage, game statistics, and gacha behavior.
*   **‚ùì Dynamic Help Command**: Provides a comprehensive list of all available commands or detailed information about a specific command.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Framework**: Node.js
*   **Core Library**: `discord.js` v14
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Chart Generation**: `chart.js` with `node-canvas`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Mimi's architecture is designed to be modular and scalable. Here's a high-level overview:

*   **Command Handling**: Slash commands are dynamically loaded from the `src/commands` directory. The main client in `src/index.ts` listens for `InteractionCreate` events and executes the corresponding command logic.
*   **Database Interaction**: All database queries are centralized in `src/shared/database/queries.ts`, providing a clean and maintainable data access layer. It uses the `pg` library to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
*   **Caching**: To optimize performance and reduce database load, frequently accessed data like keyword and auto-reaction settings are stored in an in-memory cache, managed by `src/shared/cache.ts`.
*   **Modular Utilities**: Specialized functionalities like chart generation (`src/utils/chart-generator.ts`) and error handling (`src/utils/errorHandler.ts`) are encapsulated in their own modules.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the bot locally.

### Step 1: Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mimi.git
cd mimi
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to edit the `.env` file with the following values:

*   `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot's token.
*   `CLIENT_ID`: Your bot's client ID.
*   `DB_HOST`: Database host.
*   `DB_PORT`: Database port.
*   `DB_USER`: Database username.
*   `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password.
*   `DB_NAME`: Database name.

### Step 4: Set Up the Database

The application is designed to work with a PostgreSQL database. The required table schemas are defined in `src/shared/database/schema.sql`. You will need to manually create the tables in your database.

## üèÉ Running the Bot

### Step 1: Build the Code

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy Slash Commands

Before starting the bot, you need to register its slash commands with Discord.

```bash
npm run deploy
```
This command reads all command files from `dist/commands` and registers them globally.

### Step 3: Start the Bot

You can run the bot in two modes:

*   **Development Mode**: Uses `nodemon` for hot-reloading.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
*   **Production Mode**: Runs the compiled JavaScript code.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add a new command, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new file in the `src/commands/` directory (e.g., `src/commands/new-command.ts`).
2.  Use the existing commands as a template. You'll need to export a `data` object using `SlashCommandBuilder` and an `execute` function to handle the command's logic.
3.  If your command requires database interaction, add the necessary query functions to `src/shared/database/queries.ts`.
4.  Once your command is ready, run `npm run deploy` to register it with Discord.
